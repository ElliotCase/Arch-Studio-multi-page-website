  Seraph Station

  The Seraph Station project challenged us to design a unique station that would
  transport people through time. The result is a fresh and futuristic model
  inspired by space stations.

  Federal II Tower

  A sequel theme project for a tower originally built in the 1800s. We achieved
  this with a striking look of brutal minimalism with modern touches.

  Trinity Bank Tower

  Trinity Bank challenged us to make a concept for a 84 story building located
  in the middle of a city with a high earthquake frequency. For this project we
  used curves to blend design and stability to meet our objectives.
